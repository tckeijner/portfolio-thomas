    "bioText": "As a former teacher, I know that anything you set your mind to can be learned. With that knowledge I set out to pursue a new dream in IT. It turned out this goal was a lot more suitable for my interests and abilities. After my first years my experience was already quite diverse, having worked as a Front end engineer (Angular, Sitecore), and before that as a Unix Engineer (Red Hat, Chef/Ruby, Bash, Terraform). So far, working in web development suits me very well, but I love solving many problems."

    "bioText": "As a former music teacher, one of my other great passions is music. Although I am happy I do not practice music professionally anymore, it still helps me relax a lot. Especially making music with friends I met during music college is a great energizer. Here you see me playing and singing during my final concert, which is a curricular exam at the conservatory."
